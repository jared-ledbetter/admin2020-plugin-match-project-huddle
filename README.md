# admin2020-plugin-match-project-huddle
When using the Admin 2020 plugin and the Easy Custom JS &amp;amp; CSS plugin (Envato Elements) here is the Admin2020 CSS to add so you can use Dark Mode. (*note* the "Add" buttons for the plugin don't work, but it's fairly easy to deactivate the Admin 2020 plugin long enough to create the new file)
